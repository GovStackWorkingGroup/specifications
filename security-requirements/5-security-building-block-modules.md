# 5 Security Building Block Modules

The functional requirements section lists the technical capabilities that the security building block MUST have. Although API Management and Gateway services are an architectural element, this section of the document also describes the detailed functional requirements for implementing API management, governance and gateway services for GovStack. Explicitly, the communications between all building blocks (BB’s) and applications shall be via open API based access.&#x20;

The goal of this endeavor is to address primary security concerns centrally and create a consistent way of implementing a modern cloud-ready architecture to publish API’s to 3rd parties (both internal and external), govern and manage the access to API’s both internally and externally by policy and create centralized and secure point of access to each and every API endpoint exposed through GovStack. These functional requirements do not define specific APIs (API’s themselves are implemented by [<mark style="color:blue;">other building blocks</mark>](https://docs.egovstack.net/v1.1.0/)<mark style="color:blue;">)</mark> - these functional requirements only define the functionality that must be implemented within the bounds of the security building block and how it needs to be applied to other building blocks.

The following features and functions are required (both functional and non-functional) - see elaboration of these below:

| <h4>5.1.2 Standards Based Identity and Access</h4><p>The ability to implement standardized authentication, authorization and encryption protocols including federated identity (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SAML2, SSO, SSL, TLS etc.). These standards MUST be supported and incorporated into any chosen API Management product out-of-the-box for controlling access to API interfaces. </p><p><br></p><p>Note that the native API interfaces for each building block's components may be implemented in clear text with no authentication and/or encryption etc. so long as the access to these interfaces is firewalled by network and network policy such that it is ONLY accessible through the API Gateway. This is intended to simplify, standardize and expedite API development, deployment and management.</p><p><br></p><p>Note that the APi interface specifications for the APi gateway and API management services are based on open standards based identity and access which is in turn based on OpenAPI 3.0. The following link describes how OAuth2 is used in OpenAPI 3.0 standards based identity and access: <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/">https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/</a>. It is this style of standards based identity and access that is required to be supported, Note that additional API interfaces may be exposed by the API Management and Gateway solution but they would predominantly be targeted for incorporation into the DevOps CI/CD tool chain not exposed to other BBs. </p> | MUST                                                                                           | build                                                                                     |

Applications and application-specific entitlements such as membership to an LDAP group or a role on a public cloud provider such as AWS must be supported as a part of the access grant process.</p><p><br></p><p>The access request feature must also include the optional selection of a “Profile Role” capability – which is a role defined for a job/position that can grant access to a number of applications that are needed for a particular job role (otherwise known as delegation).<br><br></p><p>The access request/approval workflows provided must support:</p><ul><li>Multiple approvers – Must be able to define as many approval steps needed and select common targets such as a supervisor, object owner or admin, and group of approvers.</li><li>Service Level Agreements (SLA) - Must ensure that tasks are completed in a timely manner so if they are not, then they can be escalated to the appropriate person after expiry time.</li></ul><p>The access request approval functionality must also support basic “delegated approval” and “out of office” functionality so that there are no barriers to self service access requests when the usual approvers are not available.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | MUST                                                                                           | deploy                                                                                    |
| <h4>5.2.9 REST API</h4><p>A REST (representational state transfer) based API for external integration of the provisioning and deprovisioning of users etc.. is required. It must support the same OpenAPI standards defined by the Architecture Blueprint and Functional Requirements (see Ref 1).

This is intended as an example of the API style that is expected in such a suite.

| <h4>5.2.11 Access Certification </h4><p>Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPPA and SOX combined with an increased focus on security are causing both public and private organizations to implement access certification policies. Scheduled access certification campaigns aid in complying with these regulatory mandates as well as improve security by guarding against the access violations which lead to security breaches. </p><p><br></p><p>However, when performed manually, these activities can be error prone and very time consuming for most mid to large organizations. The lack of consistency resulting from manual processes results in failed compliance audits and threats resulting from unauthorized access can slip undetected. The IAM solution must provide the ability to automate the access certification process which addresses the challenges found when performing these processes manually. </p><p><br></p><p>The following types of certifications must be supported by the IAM solution:</p><ul><li>User Access Certification</li><li>Application Access Certification</li><li>Group Access Certification</li></ul><p>These campaigns can be scheduled and run at regular intervals or they can be run on demand. The Access Certification functionality in the IAM solution must provide organizations with the following capabilities:</p><ul><li>Human Friendly Reviews: End-users (reviewers) using the IAM solution access certification functionality must be able to perform their activities in a familiar self-service user interface. Reviewers must be able to review all the historical access in a central location as well as use tools to compare access (date, time, service etc.) between individuals.</li><li>Closed Loop Revocations: During the certification process, reviewers must be able to revoke accounts and entitlements with a simple one-click mechanism. The closed-loop validation mechanism will then ensure that revoked access has been deprovisioned from the target applications.</li><li>Support for Cloud, On-Premise and Hybrid Cloud: An increasing number of organizations today have hybrid environments where applications are deployed both on-premise and in the cloud. The IAM solution must provide a central identity governance platform such that the same consistent certification programs can be undertaken irrespective of the applications and infrastructure location.</li></ul><p><br></p> | MUST                                                                                           | deploy                                                                                    |

This may or may not be used in practice but is a desired feature.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | SHOULD                                                                                         | deploy                                                                                    |

## 5.3 Service APIs

This section describes external APIs that must be implemented by the building block. Additional APIs may be implemented by the building block (all APIs must adhere to the standards and protocols defined), but the listed APIs define a minimal set that must be provided by any implementation.&#x20;

All APIs will be defined using the OpenAPI (Swagger) standard. The API definitions will be hosted outside of this document. This section may provide a brief description of required APIs. This section will primarily contain links to the GitHub repository for OpenAPI definition (yaml) files as well as to a website hosted by GovStack that provides a live API documentation portal. The basic assumption here is that the IAM suite will be acquired and not built. The suite MUST supply an appropriate API with documented endpoints.

IAM Suite API: An example of such a REST API is provided with the OpenIAM suite specification here: [https://www.openiam.com/products/identity-governance/features/api/](https://www.openiam.com/products/identity-governance/features/api/). This is intended as an example of the API style that is expected in such a suite. This is not definitive and may vary based on the proposed IAM suite. The detailed API documentation for OpenIAM including interface specifications can be found here: [https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.1.14/html/API/index.htm](https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.1.14/html/API/index.htm)

OAuth2 API: The following link describes how OAuth2 is used in OpenAPI 3.0 standards based identity and access: [https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/).&#x20;

SCEP API: A description of the OpenXPKI enrollment workflow and API can be found here: [https://openxpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/configuration/workflows/enroll.html](https://openxpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/configuration/workflows/enroll.html). This is an example of how an API for enrolment with its associated workflow should be implemented within the Certificate Authority Server.

LDAP API: A description of the standard REST LDAP API provided by the open source 389 Directory Server here: [https://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/design/ldap-rest-api.html#ldap-rest-api](https://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/design/ldap-rest-api.html#ldap-rest-api) . This is an example of how an open API for credential storage and retrieval using LDAP should be implemented.

## 5.4 Workflows

A workflow provides a detailed view of how this building block will interact with other building blocks to support common use cases.&#x20;

This section lists workflows that this building block must support. Other workflows may be implemented in addition to those listed.

No specific workflow definitions are required for this building block as they will be inherited by the tools/products chosen to address each security issue/concern and fundamentally deal with the other building blocks API’s in a cross-cutting manner as in the case of API Management.&#x20;

Other components of the Security BB such as the IAM Suite will also provide their own workflow tools but the details of the actual workflow need to be designed once more is known. An example of the type of default workflow provided for an IAM suite would be the basic workflow for provisioning new accounts which can be leveraged by the other BBs. This is typically a basic workflow built in a tool that can be customized to meet specific provisioning needs (perhaps with multiple administrative roles and connections to multiple external systems and modules etc.) . The following link describes an example the basic workflow for provisioning provided by Open IAM (one of the alternatives) [https://www.openiam.com/products/identity-governance/features/provisioning/](https://www.openiam.com/products/identity-governance/features/provisioning/)

Note that each building block is responsible for the defining base configurations and workflows required to be created in the IAM system that enable identity and access to be provisioned. Essentially the IAM system needs to be augmented with adapters to enable identity and access to be provisioned to target systems and resources in the way that the target applications implement their own identity and access. Alternatively  where applications are built from the ground up they can leverage the IAM suite sAPI services to implement authentication and access.&#x20;

These specific workflows and adapters can be defined at the detailed design stage and communicated to the Security WG for implementation in the IAM solution. It must be noted that the security WG is NOT responsible for determining the identity and access policy and the details of access for each role for example. The following need to be identified by each building block and communicated to the Security WG for implementation in the IAM suite configuration build:

* Resource Types: for example files, services, API’s, applications, modules to be protected by IAM.
* Resources: The definitions of the actual resources and their type provided by and required by each BB that are to be secured through IAM. This must include the target system or component that hosts these resources so that the correct provisioning adapter can be configured for that resource. Note that where the BB or resource has its own identity and access scheme an adapter can be written using the IAM suite API.
* Roles: the roles of users of each system that include the required resource access for that role in terms of the Resources. Each BB must account for the access they require to be provisioned to other services as a part of their process scope. In the case of provisioning a new account there is a need for a broader workflow process that is outside the scope of the Security BB which incorporates the Identity and Registration BB. For example a Doctor role may require verification and validation of certain aspects of identity prior to provisioning access to a specific service. A basic set of sequence diagrams is provided below to reinforce the understanding of what is required.
* Approval Workflows: workflow for the approval of the various identity and access requests (complete with approval roles etc).

### 5.4.1 Identity and Access Sequences&#x20;

The following sequence diagrams depict the basic means by which authentication and access control shall be implemented across building blocks. Note that by definition an account with no access can be created by any user. via self-registration. Self-registration using basic phone/email as well as strong self registration using foundational ID are to be supported . A sequence detailing technical authentication is also included below along with sequences defining the remaining aspects of the identity lifecycle (such as provisioning and deprovisioning of access) to be supported by the IAM suite and how they will be leveraged by all building blocks. Such workflows can be articulated in full during the detailed design phase:

#### **5.4.1.1 User authentication and authorization**

![See https://www.websequencediagrams.com/  for an editable diagram](<../.gitbook/assets/www.websequencediagrams.com (1).png>)

This assumes the user already has an account. Authentication credentials are username or phone number and password.

The auth token could be signed with an expiration (JWT) which might allow the BB to perform the validation themselves. Additionally, if the token contains roles and/or a user ID and isn’t expired the BB could potentially rely on those.

#### **5.4.1.2 Self-registration via phone number or email**

![See https://www.websequencediagrams.com/  for an editable diagram ](<../.gitbook/assets/www.websequencediagrams.com (4).png>)

#### **5.4.1.3 Self-registration via foundational ID**

For a specification, see the [Identity and Verification Building Block](https://docs.egovstack.net/v1.1.0/Identity\_and\_Verification\_Building\_Block\_Specification\_v1.1.0.pdf) Specification.

Note that role creation (e.g. farmers, doctors) is handled by the IAM solution, via either an administration UI or an API. Building blocks can create roles via the API to provision new roles.

It’s assumed the user clicked a link to access the service in the Building block UI.&#x20;

The users are authorized with a valid access token for their email or phone number.

#### **5.4.1.4 Self-deprovisioning via foundational ID**

![See https://www.websequencediagrams.com/  for an editable diagram](../.gitbook/assets/www.websequencediagrams.com.png)

This flow assumes the user has an account and is currently authenticated.

#### **5.4.1.5 Deprovisioning via government official**

![See https://www.websequencediagrams.com/  for an editable diagram](<../.gitbook/assets/www.websequencediagrams.com (3).png>)

This flow assumes the user has an account and is currently authenticated.

#### 5.4.2 Standards

The workflows MUST adhere to all standards defined in this document as well as in the GovStack architecture document (link to appropriate section in architecture document)

**No specific standard workflows are required in the context of the security building block. All workflows involving identity and access for example are the responsibility of each building block working group and to be defined during detailed design. Such workflows can and should be implemented using the workflow engine built into the IAM suite and perhaps extended from or to a meta-workflow defined in the context of another BB.**

#### 5.4.3 Interaction with Other Building Blocks

The security building block predominantly deals with the cross-cutting security concerns of each other building block and defines the basis for the implementation of solutions to address these concerns. The only interaction required is for API Management and Gateway services. These interactions are depicted and documented in Architecture Blueprint and Functional Requirements (see [Ref 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9jS0BnfTM3azBED5349uD5sQ9VYYo8p/edit#heading=h.k32er9gmkfp0)).

#### 5.4.4 Example Sequence Diagrams for API Gateway Services

The sequence diagrams below depict examples of how a building block might interact with the API Management and Gateway solution. This is only relevant for the API Management and Gateway services in the context of the security building block. A higher level sequence diagram depicting API interactions for building blocks is depicted and documented in Architecture Blueprint and Functional Requirements (see [Ref 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9jS0BnfTM3azBED5349uD5sQ9VYYo8p/edit#heading=h.k32er9gmkfp0)).
