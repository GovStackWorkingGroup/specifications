| 1       | Payments BB has core requirements called out. However, the Voucher mgmt system can be made more generalised.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | One powerful feature that facilitates generic characteristics in the VMS in the specification is the use of voucher groups. These groups can restrict the use of vouchers to certain functions, geographies and merchants.  One extension we could do is to add a custom field to the Voucher Management System API so that the calling Building Block could submit data regarding how the voucher is to be used and by whom. However, as per the use cases the voucher initiation and redemption are triggered by other Building Blocks so this data is actually collected by the calling Building Block.  In terms of the final delivery of the voucher this in control of the calling Building block                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Such reports would trigger, either automatically or manually, requests for "re-stocking" of vouchers. As of this time my understanding is that the detailed reporting requirements are out of the scope of this document.</p><p>2) Reconciliation of funds and vouchers is a key part of the ecosystem. However, the funding of accounts and the management of funds is, to my understanding, out of the scope of this document.</p><p>3) The authentication of the beneficiary at the point of redemption, as per my understanding, will lie with the calling block which would likely check the Registry building block to authenticate the user. Other flows could involve the voucher management server storing the beneficiary details but this would appear to go against the principle of avoiding duplication. This may also need consideration of consent in cases where delegation applies.</p> |
