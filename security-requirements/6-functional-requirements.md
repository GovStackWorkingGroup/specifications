# 6  Functional Requirements

### 6.1  Identity Registration <a href="#docs-internal-guid-54ffa6d1-7fff-1219-8f59-d45ca47b2ad7" id="docs-internal-guid-54ffa6d1-7fff-1219-8f59-d45ca47b2ad7"></a>

The following UML sequence diagram shows a simple classical identity registration followed by issuance of an identity credential.&#x20;

It could be detailed more around how the registration appointment is taken, how the data reaches the registration server, include creation of token identifiers, manage collection  of person consent, determine options for format of the ID credential (physical or digital) and its sending back to the applicant..

Purpose of that diagram is to illustrate the key steps of the process and services involved.

## 6.2  Identity Verification <a href="#docs-internal-guid-2affb3f5-7fff-fa73-9e68-7707b820858d" id="docs-internal-guid-2affb3f5-7fff-fa73-9e68-7707b820858d"></a>

Identity verification can be performed in several ways and based on several inputs depending on various criteria.

For example, Identity verification will be performed according to:

* **Context of identity verification** : online, face to face by third party, self identity verification, in the absence of infrastructure and technologies.
* **Capacities given to the individual**: having an ID Card, a person Identifier, a password or PIN code, using its biometrics, mobile subscription or smartphone.
* **Status of the individual**: can he/she read ? Does he have usable fingerprints ? Is he/she old enough to have an ID Card?
* **Level of trust required**: according to sensitivity of the operations, level of assurance required, policies established by the state or by the service provider,  multiple factor identity verification.
* **Business constraints**: does the use case require to be very fast, touchless, seamless, physical or digital
* **Local laws and regulations**:  the identity verification could differ according to local regulations and laws which may indicate specific ways to perform identity verification.

### 6.2.1  Capabilities

Below shown table will list the different capabilities that can be used to perform an identity verification, the Identity & Verification Building Block may use any of them including combination of several of them to verify a person identity.

Through this list of capabilities we can see there are numerous but limited options for Identity Verification that can be combined or not, this list allows us to normalize them all into the following inputs for an identity verification:

1. **Identifier**: identifier referring to a digital retrievable identity which can give access to an individual's attributes for verification. To be noted that several kinds of identifier could be used to refer to the same person, which is particularly important to preserve privacy (see glossary).
2. **Set of attributes**: attributes provided by the individual or retrieved on/within its Identity credential for purpose of a matching versus a reference (online or ID credential), those attributes can be biographic data, biometrics data or scan of identity evidence.
3. **Authentication token**: A previous identity verification token can be used for identity verification, this token would allow the current service provider to verify against the authenticating system the genuinity of the token.

## 6.3  Use Cases <a href="#docs-internal-guid-dcbda535-7fff-1e71-07b5-815d5f9c5e1d" id="docs-internal-guid-dcbda535-7fff-1e71-07b5-815d5f9c5e1d"></a>

### 6.3.1  Use Case 1: Identity Enrollment&#x20;

Enrollment to a National Digital Identity is a sensible process as the created digital identity will be recognized by law and then consequence of its use.&#x20;

In some countries, it’s possible to enroll a National Digital Identity remotely based on an existing form of identity like for example an ID card. If they are convenient they open the risk for fraud or identity theft.

For all these reasons, it appears that an identity enrollment has to be rolled-out in a face to face proces, with collection of identity attributes being demographic, biometrics or related proof of them.&#x20;

This process will be developed later, for now we can list its main steps for the face process::

1. Explanation of purpose of process and usage that will be made of data
2. Identity verification: process start by providing evidence of identity (birth certificate, or previous ID card, passport, ..)
3. Collection of demographic data (confirmed with evidences provided)
4. Collection of biometric data including&#x20;
   1. Generally a portrait capture which will be used to visually recognize the person, for example printed on a ID card
   2. Sometimes fingerprints and iris are captured for identity deduplication purpose or for further biometric authentication
5. Scan of identity evidences to sustain the identity attributes certification
6. Collection of external identifiers (Birth ID number, Social security card number, ..) to establish links with external pre-existing forms of Identity
7. Verification of the data captured by the individual
8. Consent collection to launch registration process&#x20;
9. Delivery of a registration number
10. In case Enrollment process be synchronous issuance and delivery of a unique identity number

\


These are only the steps visible by the individual and the process will pursue within IDV BB notably with following steps:

1. Packing and securing the data (signature & encryption)
2. Transport of data to identity registration system
3. Control of format and origin of data collected to ensure their authenticity
4. Control of eligibility criterias
   1. Could include biometrics unicity in case of centralized identity
   2. Could include additional checks like nationality, age, (but those ones are not recommended to ensure an inclusive system)
5. Generation of a Unique Identity number
6. Storage of identity data by respecting privacy by design principles
7. Communication of the Unique Identity Number to the individual
8. Eventual issuance of a physical or digital credential
9. Optionally notification of the systems around having subscribed to identity creation events (ie social security, health, finance, education, ..)

#### 6.3.1  Use Case 2: Identity Verification Generic&#x20;

The following diagram introduces what are the different steps, interactions and stakeholders of generic use cases of identity verification.

The possible inputs being what the capabilities just presented in the [Capabilities ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fvt6Y6h2yd4JeoSNAZnemnQQqdOTlje3bA1bGnGXLcU/edit#heading=h.35nkun2)section and the output being an authentication token.

It’s to be noted that the identity verification is generally a stop point as part of an overall business process which is expecting to perform afterward

1. Control of authorization of the verified identity to access to some services
2. Eventually collection of some attributes related to the identity. After individual consent (managed with Consent Building Block) and under authorization of access to the requesting services provider.

#### 6.3.2  Use case 3: Cross-Border Recognition of Professional Jobs  <a href="#docs-internal-guid-65b24984-7fff-ebe8-9b8f-f14c39815ae4" id="docs-internal-guid-65b24984-7fff-ebe8-9b8f-f14c39815ae4"></a>

As regional member states’ economies become more integrated, the need for cross-border recognition of professional jobs has increased. There is a desire to boost intra-African trade and the [<mark style="color:blue;">African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) seeks to create an integrated market of 1.7 billion consumers by 2030 with an aggregated GDP of up to US$3.4 trillion</mark>](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditc2017d2\_en.pdf).

Services are an essential part of integration efforts, as recognized by governments in the context of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (Mohamed, 2020). Trade in services can help economies achieve more rapid growth, enhance domestic firms’ competitiveness, and promote inclusiveness in terms of skills, gender and the location of economic activity. Trade in services also promotes a more efficient allocation of resources and greater economies of scale. It can lead to an increase in the variety of services available to consumers and producers. Beyond these usual sources of gains, some services sectors have special or unique features that may amplify how an economy can benefit from trade in services. In focus here, services sectors have an outsized impact on factors of production, like labour. For example, the productivity of an economy’s labour force depends on how educated, skilled and healthy it is, attributes which hinge crucially on the quality of that economy’s educational and health systems, as well as the ability to enable cross border exchange of labour.

This use case examines the recognition of high-skilled jobs.
