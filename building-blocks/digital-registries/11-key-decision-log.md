# 11 Key Decision Log

* The UNCTAD’s Generic Database Builder (eRegistrations) system will be used as a reference system  in describing the functional requirements.
* 23.09.2021 - WG meeting, based on review recommendations made by Architecture WG, we decided to add API services or IT-specialists to create/modify/delete registry database schema.
* 22.11.2021 - Coverage map chapter will be added to the document.
* 28.02.2022 - Review comments incorporated to the main document (v1.1.0)  24.02.2022 (see below). Future consideration chapter updated based on reviewers comments. Recommendations not to be considered in this building block documented (see below)

In the Digital Registries user interface it must be possible to open another database by clicking on the ID of one database and all corresponding records from the other database  will open. In API, the developers can decide how to use the Foreign key to improve the UX.    </p><p><br></p><p>Modifications to be absorbed in this version:</p><p>We improved the functionality description.<br><br></p> |
| <p>DRS-3</p><p>1. does it includes Dropbox option to select from List of Values (LOV)? How can I define List values and how can I attach it to field in a form?</p><p>2.

Digital registries is storing data/ key of the list element. Catalogs are managed in Registration BB/ other BB.<br><br></p><p>2.

| <p>6. </p><p>I was talking about the REST endpoint URL. The URL has a placeholder for version (marked as {version}). I believe it to be the version of the API being called, but the document throughout talks about DB schema version, and no mention of this version being the version of the API. That could create confusions on what the parameter "version" is.</p> | <p><br>Thank you for the clarification. Will be implemented in this version. </p><p>The system generates default API method endpoints automatically after each publish of the database schema. A new API service version is generated after each schema publish. Database schema version and API versions are in sync. I hope this clarifies the confusion.</p>                                                                                                                                                                   |
