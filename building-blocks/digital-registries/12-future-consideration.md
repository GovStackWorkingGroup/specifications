# 12  Future Consideration

12.1 Integration with a blockchain solution to guarantee the integrity of the data and logs. The function would notice unauthorized changes in data. This option may be available with a fee therefore should be optional.&#x20;

12.2 Implementation improvements- system installation could be done with more simplifications so it would be a full SAAS cloud solution. &#x20;

12.3 Data validation and evaluation tools could be developed into the core Registries BB logic so it would generate warnings if data quality issues appear.

12.4 Event based automated data export from Registries BB to legacy databases. Connection with messaging and workflow BB is required.&#x20;

12.5 Plug-in no-code connector to existing registry databases. It's currently a challenge to connect to existing registry databases. As a solution, the Digital Registries BB could offer a plug-in tool to connect existing databases to Information Mediator without the need to develop custom connectors.&#x20;

12.6 Open data component. It should be possible to mark down the data that must be visible as open data (API, bulk download). &#x20;

12.7 Personal data usage in Digital Registries in synchronization with Consent Management BB capabilities. &#x20;

12.8 Enable to connect Digital Registries BB to Verifiable Credential networks   (W3C VC).&#x20;

12.9 Analyze a way to enable analyst to decide which data must be encrypted while in rest. The goal is to secure data while in rest.&#x20;

12.10 Data MUST be protected by proper anonymisation with analytics and related reporting functions. Proper analysis and user requirements mapping must be done based on a real use case.&#x20;

12.11 Maintenance functionalities and roles to help everyday operations of registries.

12.12  Review results to be added to the next versions of the specifications. See decisions in the following table.

| <p>DRS-3 Add fields to DB schema. </p><p>Does that means that collection types are not supported? For example, I want Applicant to submit her employments records history and I will define fields for one employment and then I want to define a history object, which is collection of employment records sorted by time.

| <p>The scope is limited to simple registries. In real life, we are likely to have registries that require a multi level structure. In RDBMS terms, the data for a registry may need to be stored in multiple tables. It is not easy to handle such entities by defining foreign keys among tables. There should be a clear mechanism identified to handle digital registries that have a multi-level structure.</p><p><br></p><p>While it may appear easy to create a new API end point for every version, this places undue burden on the calling systems. Whenever a new API version is launched, the calling system will have to be modified to refer to the new API end point. </p><p><br></p><p>It is also quite difficult to invoke different API end points from the same front-end. Instead of this, the API end point should remain the same and the payload should indicate the version.</p> | <p>The requirements are based on a USE CASE with minimal viable product methodology. Therefore the complex database structure was not needed, thus the requirements focused on simple case. However the requirements to build more complex data storing structures can be added when use cases require it.  </p><p>Digital Registries enables to create multi level registries. </p><p><br></p><p>For example if we rename a database to a table, and tables can be linked with foreign keys, then we have a multi level registry. In Digital Registries description we decided to name the tables as databases because this improves the user experience.

Every publish creates a new version of the database schema;   </p><p>Old database schemas must be available to the users;</p><p>Data stored in the old database versions must be usable in old versions and in new versions; “</p><p>This description should be clear enough to explain that the users can still work with old API versions and do not have to switch to new API versions right away. However there is a risk that large schema changes may influence the old APi versions and therefore the system has a limit. We will analyze the risks and schema version options in the V2. </p><p><br></p> |
| <p>2.2 Event based notifications.</p><p>I see that as an issue. Subject of the Registry record may have specific life-cycle and on event of life-cycle there is a need to do some things, which is the reason why Registry even exists. For example, when driver license is expiring and state cannot notify person about that - I would say it is dysfunctional registry of driver licenses.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <p>Yes, this function will be added in the iteration 2.

| The authors try to treat analyst and administrator as one user category and applicant as another user category. It could be a better idea to have three distinct roles viz., analyst, administrator and applicant. The analyst should be responsible for preparing the design and he/she should control the database design. The analyst should have no role to play in data administration. That responsibility should be with the administrator. Otherwise, we may be combining the responsibilities of architects and operators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <p>Use cases currently do not require administrators.
