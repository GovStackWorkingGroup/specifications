# 4 Cross-Cutting Requirements

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the [Architecture specification](../architecture-and-nonfunctional-requirements/) and [Security requirements](../security-requirements/). This section will highlight important requirements or describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this building block.

**Secure ingress and Egress access mechanisms** (Information Mediator and api gateway)

Egress, in the world of networking, implies traffic that exits an entity or a network boundary, while Ingress is traffic that enters the boundary of a network. In the cloud, Ingress means something slightly different. Private networks here refers to resources inside the network boundary of a data center or cloud environment and its IP space is completely under the control of an entity who operates it.
