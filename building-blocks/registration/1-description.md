# 1 Description

“Registration” is a process through which an applicant gets **information recorded in a registry** and receives a **credential** as a proof of registration, in exchange for providing **information**, with or without **money**.&#x20;

The information provided by the applicant consists of **data** and/or of **credentials** issued by public or private entities. **Money** is provided to pay for one or more registration fees/costs.

A registration involves at least **two parties**: an **applicant** who wants to register (something or somebody) and an authorized representative of a **registrar** in charge of registering the data and issuing the credential.

A registration may involve more than two parties: one or more **third parties** can be requested to **assert/confirm the information** provided by the applicant (a notary, a family member, a witness, another public entity, or a non-human entity such as a database); or to receive the **payment** made by the applicant (a bank, a cashier, an online payment service). The **registry** or registries where the information is written can also be considered as a third party.

In some cases, **multiple registration processes** can take place **simultaneously**, i.e. the same applicant gets information registered in various registries and receives various credentials, while providing information and money only once. This is known as “**single window**”, “simultaneous registrations” or “integrated registrations”.&#x20;

In practice, from the **applicant’s point of view**, a registration process can entail the following operations:

* Answer questions to determine:
  * if the applicant is eligible to register
  * the data, credentials/documents and fees required, according to the applicant’s case
* Provide data in a form, upload copies of credentials/documents
* Pay fees at a physical point of payment (bank, cashier, etc.) or through an online service
* Confirm his/her will to register
* Query the status of the registration process
* Receive credentials electronically or collect them at a physical point of collection&#x20;

From the **point of view of the entity in charge (Registrar)** of the registration, the process can include the following operations:

* Ask questions to the applicant, on one or more screens, to determine, according to the answers:
  * if the applicant is entitled to register
  * the data, documents and fees required, according to the applicant’s case
* Display, on one or various screens, the necessary fields for the applicant to enter the required data and documents (including a receipt of payment, in case the system does not propose an online payment option or if the user for some reason wants to make the payment physically or directly / in the traditional way).&#x20;
* Control that the information entered is complete and correct (and the applicant is entitled to register)&#x20;
* Validate the information submitted or, in case the information entered is incomplete or incorrect, send the file back to the applicant for correction
* When possible, call an external application allowing the applicant to pay the fees online
* Record the applicant’s information in a registry
* Issue a credential as a proof of registration&#x20;
