# 10 Key Decision Log



1. Registration BB and Digital Registries BB is separated into two blocks.&#x20;
2. The UNCTAD’s [eRegistrations ](http://businessfacilitation.org/online-single-windows/)system will be used as a reference system as it fulfills most of the BB requirements.
3. Additional section “Coverage map” will be added.
4. “Coverage map” was moved to section 6.3.
5. Infrastructure capabilities added (9.5). 05.12.2021
6. Review comments incorporated to the main document  24.02.2022 (see below). Future consideration chapter updated based on reviewers comments. Recommendations not to be considered in this building block documented (see below)

| <p>My comment more regarding the first sentence: „A registration may involve</p><p>more than two parties: one or more third parties can be requested to assert/confirm the information provided by the applicant (a notary, a family member, a witness, another public entity, or a non-human entity such</p><p>as a database);“ because the issuer of the electronic signature /certificate guarantees the identity of the owner of the certificate and in that sense also guarantees financially that the owner of the signature /certificate is the person or entity for which he / she represents himself /herself. In that sense, it belongs to the "third parties" if I understood the meaning of this section well.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <p>Modifications not feasible.</p><p>Interesting thought to validate the uploaded documents signed with electronic signature. The purpose for this chapter was to validate the information filled in by the user (e.g. first name, last name, ID, DoB, etc. ).

| <p>6. Resource model</p><p>This model seems to be limited only with the processing part of the registration and excludes usage of Registry part. Also, Digital Registries component doesn't show anywhere Registry-Subject model as per terminology section #2 (see above). Aim of registration process is always to create registry which can be heavily used for queries. For example financial services authority after issuing licenses will be doing regular risks monitoring and for that they need to have Registry of Companies with types of issued licenses with all related individuals. I am not sure that I understand how such usage can be implemented by the the Registration BB and Digital registries BB.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <p>May be related to requirement SF-7. </p><p>Registration BB is to collect and submit data to the registration Authority. Once the authority users have made a decision to enter data to the registry, then the system passes the data to Digital Registries BB (or to existing registry). If there are consumers of this registry data, then they have an option to ask this information via UI services in Registration BB or via Open API in Digital Registries BB.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <p>6. </p><p>such generic approach to a data model of the registration process seems to be not very practical. In reality, as terminology section put forward, there are Subject and Applicant, which may have its own complex structure. Omitting Subject and Applicant in the data model put the whole heavy load of modelling of the processing flow and Registry onto users and as such added value of such component seems to be too small. In reality, Subject always has some legal entities and/or persons and/or property/assets. And data attributes are normally attached to some combination of this triad: legal entity, individual and asset. I think, Registration BB and Digital Registries BB should address this complexity. Otherwise it will not be useful for public sector. It will be easier just to ask developer to create using Python or JS/Node just regular code to do processing.</p>                                     | <p>We have chosen the principles of NO-CODE. Thus analyst must be able achieve the same goal without writing code. Data is defined based on domain in focus. Each e-service domain model is different. In this version our focus was postpartum infant care use cases. </p><p><br></p><p>As the BB is highly flexible there is no need to write the entity data into the data model. Each process has its own data model and the system must be able to facilitate this (all domains). In Mother and Child postpartum use case there is no mention of a company. If such entity will appear, then this can be added to the custom data structure and process by the analyst. System can facilitate any process and user screen. .</p> |
| The requirements mentioned here are quite specific. To cater to these requirements, a new type of no-code development platform may be needed and the existing no-code platforms may not suffice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <p>As mentioned in the specification there are multiple products selected as reference.

| <p>There are broadly two types of no-code platforms. No-code platforms that facilitate quick front-end development and no-code platforms that enable end-to-end application development.<br><br></p><p>For the first category of no-code development platforms, the starting point is often APIs. They facilitate seamless integration with APIs by citizen developers (analysts) and they also allow rapid development of the front-end based on those APIs.</p><p><br>For the second category of no-code development platforms, the entities along with their APIs (digital registries in our context) are created first, the APIs from those entities are used to build process flows and finally the front-end is also developed based on either the process flows or the APIs.<br><br></p><p>It may be a better idea to check whether the requirements can be aligned with the way the existing no-code development platforms work.</p><p><br></p> | Requirements are envisioned to fulfill the needs of a no-code platform (the second one).
