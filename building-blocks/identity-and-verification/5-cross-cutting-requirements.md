# 5 Cross-Cutting Requirements

The following requirements should be added to other BB cross cutting requirements.

## 5.1  Consent Management  <a href="#docs-internal-guid-da47132b-7fff-3138-7667-f87bd4540eb3" id="docs-internal-guid-da47132b-7fff-3138-7667-f87bd4540eb3"></a>

Whilst ID and Verification as defined and understood in this Building Block should be supported by local or supranational laws and regulations (like internal security or global AML rules), translation of the appropriate use in reality is complex and hardly enforceable. Hence, we recommend that any solution should have a defined consent management mechans√Æsm by design. The specifications for such mechanisms are out of scope for this Building Block, but should follow the following requirements:&#x20;

1. Consent should be created in the context of the user and should be available to the user.
2. Take consideration of consent receipts (Greig, S. (2017). Kantara Initiative Releases the First Open, Global Consent Receipt Specification, Kantara (available at [https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-initiative-releases-first-open-global-consent-receipt-specification/](https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-initiative-releases-first-open-global-consent-receipt-specification/))
3. Following the logic that a user is asked to give consent for a particular activity / data share.  (Some other system is linking the user with the activity).  Assuming that the overall system sends the consent request to the appropriate  user then their response (I give consent) is stored and managed in the consent management BB or any other responsible party).  If the user is a mother who does not yet have a registered identity they can still be the 'person' who is asked for their consent.
4. Address ownership of register and access questions: presumably the consent register is only held by the data controller who is acting on the basis of the consent.
5. Purpose limitation of the consent.
6. A request response approach or a link to a transaction ID and parties and date would also help.
7. An assisted model would also be required, where 3rd party agencies can come in to collect consent from the user.
8. Apart from technical requirements, it is helpful to differentiate between consent as an ethical process versus consent as a legal basis for processing personal data (certainly under GDPR).

## 5.2  Security Requirements

The Cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the [Security requirements](../security-requirements/). They can be found in the section 3.5 Digital ID/Certificate Functional Requirements:

A feature for invalidating, locking or disenrollment/revocation of the digital ID shall also be provided as a response measure to both human citizen subjects leaving the system and responding to security breaches encountered. Digital certificate enrollment must be provided by the solution but is not required for every human citizen subject (see below).</p><p><br></p><p>Note that it is anticipated that the Identity BB will call this feature either directly via API or indirectly via the IAM features of the Security BB for users electing to use an electronic ID consisting of certificates as a part of the account provisioning process. The digital ID will then be stored with the physical ID records in the identity BB and sent to the new user via secure means (probably installed on their device).</p><p><br></p><p>Note that simple numerical digital IDs will also be supported for human citizen subjects as an option where users are unable to leverage certificates based digital ID.

## 5.3  Trust Framework

Trust Frameworks can be considered a mechanism to enable the trusted exchange of information between sovereign partners. The Trust Framework is a much discussed concept and this report recommends including the specifications in the second iteration as a sub-Building Block whereby additional experts should be included.&#x20;
