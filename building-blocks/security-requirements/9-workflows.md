# 9  Workflows

If GovStack will offer global workflow management for cross-building block use cases, IDV BB will have its internal workflows for its own internal business flows execution.

Non exhaustive list of example :

* For on-boarding a new individual
* For managing identity changes after an event on a person's identity (name change, death, ..)
* For life cycle management of individuals identity evidence (ie ID Cards)
* For management of access rights to services on individuals data.

Those workflows will be described in later version, but some of them are already available as flow diagrams in this document (see [Use Cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fvt6Y6h2yd4JeoSNAZnemnQQqdOTlje3bA1bGnGXLcU/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv) section)&#x20;
