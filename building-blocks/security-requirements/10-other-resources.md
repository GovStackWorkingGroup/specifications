* Verifiable credentials (to be covered in the next iteration of this document in more details): W3C [https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
* ISO/IEC 24760

Equally, a future implementor might look for open source options for the modules introduced in this document. In this case, the team is suggesting:&#x20;

* Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP): github.com/mosip, which also includes information about their APIs: MOSIP: https://docs.mosip.io/platform/apis
