| OAuth2               | An open standards based  protocol used for Authentication that uses bearer tokens and is specifically designed to work across HTTP. OAuth provides clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without providing credentials.

Access for realms can be federated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <p>A realm is a security policy domain defined for a web or application server.
