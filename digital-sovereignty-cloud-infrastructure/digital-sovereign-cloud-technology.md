# Digital sovereign cloud technology

Software is only a facet of of the picture “digital sovereignty” (see below), but an important base for it. The decision for a software stack for a governmental environment should be taken consciously and educated. Here are some points to be considered to gain real digital sovereignty:&#x20;

* software licenses for all code should be open source allow for free usage and adaption, and offer the capability to contribute to and shape the software&#x20;
* the used software should be mature and proven in production, it should be resilient, scaleable, and possible to be used in large and professional environments (like enterprise clouds)&#x20;
* the software should be maintained by an active community or foundation to guarantee further development, bug fixes, support, and increased security – the community or foundation should also offer the possibility to contribute, so the national technicians can collaborate on the software development; ideally, the community is diverse and not closely associated with a single entity&#x20;
* it should use open, common standards and open interfaces&#x20;
* the cloud infrastructure should be automated, integrated, interoperable, and modular federal, so it can be also used in multi or hybrid cloud environments&#x20;
* the cloud infrastructure should be independent of the underlying hardware and operation system&#x20;
* it should reduce critical dependencies on providers through standardized, modular IT architectures&#x20;
* it should allow cross-cloud and reciprocal use of governmental applications, allowing the integration and execution of GovStack building blocks&#x20;
* it should cover all security demands and access requirements&#x20;
* Additionally: operational knowledge should be available, documented, and further developed by an active community&#x20;
* to get scalable, resilient cloud infrastructure it is recommended to have a dedicated IaaS (virtualization) layer with automated rollout and integrated monitoring and security tools&#x20;
* for application development and operations, a dedicated scalable self-service container platform is recommended with container orchestration, a container registry, and configuration management&#x20;

In recent years, open source and open technologies have played an exceptionally important role in the realization of specialized applications in the corporate and government context. However, these also require a technological basis that ensures their sovereignty in the long term. The operating environments or the cloud platforms therefore play an important role here. \
Of course, these cloud environments can be built from scratch, but there are existing solutions which cover all necessary aspects. Govstack and their partners are happy to help (one example see below).&#x20;
