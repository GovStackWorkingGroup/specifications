# 11 Future Consideration

12.1 Integration with a blockchain solution to guarantee the integrity of data and logs from unauthorized changes. This option may be available with a fee therefore should be optional.

12.2 Data storage federation (for example as a block chain)   \
Cloud storage federation model provides the integration of multiple cloud storage providers into a single virtual storage pool, eliminating the dependency on a single provider and decreasing vendor lock-in problem. Moreover, federating multiple cloud storage providers improve data availability, storage scalability and data processing performance.

12.3 Installation automation requirements- system installation could be done with full automation in a local server or in a cloud.

12.4 Integrations with Electronic signature solutions to give a consent as an applicant or a confirmation as a registrar.

12.5 The registration information may be read out aloud and displayed on screen to the applicant as operator is entering registration data.

12.6 AI supported automated registrations and decisions.

12.7 Integration with chatbot and knowledge base to support users in their walkthrough in the service.&#x20;

12.8 SMS and/or voice/natural language e-services as Plug and play BB components should be described.&#x20;

12.9 Open data component to share all data that is anonymized. Publish appropriate (i.e. anonymised) Open Data automatically on registration applications, and regularly (e.g. monthly) pseudonymised aggregate data

12.10 Review results to be added to the next versions of the specifications. See decisions below:&#x20;

| It seems, that specification currently focus only onto very simple registration cases and do not consider more complex processes, for example like financial services licensing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <p>Yes, the GovStack methodology is to focus on functionality needed for Use Cases assigned (Mother and Child registration program, Postpartum infant care).

| However, Digital registries BB looks to me like DBMS specification. For example, PostgreSQL or ORACLE RDBMS are well fit to the Digital registries BB specification. My point is that if I will try to implement some registration process, for example, in Ukraine, where I recently were engaged, I do not see much added value from the set of two specifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Digital Registries is separated BB because not all Registration processes need a new database/registry. Registration BB and Digital Registries BB can operate as one or it can be separated into multiple functional BB-s. We decided to split the functionality in order to simplify the reading. If the Registrations BB is not suitable for your processes in a country in focus, then we could use your requirements for validating our BB specification. Additional requirements can be added in the next iteration when new Use Cases are added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| There are situations, when workflow registration is one organisation and the result of registration goes to a Registry, which is different organisation.

| I do not see any requirements regarding layout of forms. For example, here is one Axure prototype for one very simple license: [https://px8vs8.axshare.com](https://px8vs8.axshare.com) (when you click on link, on top bar in left-upper corner there is is kinda hamburger icon - press it and left-side menu will appear to go through screens). This is simple license UI prototype, which has 29 pages in 4 sections: 2 sections for the self-service part and 2 parts for back-office processing.

| SF-7 Does that mean that there is also a tool to define an API request, including to map for fields to request fields and provide URL and authorisation details?
