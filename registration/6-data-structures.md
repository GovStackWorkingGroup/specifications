# 6 Data Structures

The resource model shows the relationship between data objects that are used by this Building Block.

## 6.1  Standards/Protocols

The following standards are applicable to data structures in the registration building block:

1. All dates should follow [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601).
2. RFC 7159 - The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
3. Open -API Version 3.1.0
4. QR code must be generated with the ISO/IEC 18004:2015 standard

## 6.2  Resource Model

The resource model provides a basic description of each data object that is used by the building block. It also shows the relationship between data objects.

## 6.3 Data Elements  <a href="#docs-internal-guid-719783cd-7fff-5c75-35f4-db5323cd903f" id="docs-internal-guid-719783cd-7fff-5c75-35f4-db5323cd903f"></a>

The data elements provide detail for the resource model defined above. This section will list the core/required fields for each resource.  Note that the data elements can be extended for a particular use case, but they must always contain at least the fields defined here.
