# Interoperability

Design the service to work well with other government services, systems, and platforms, using standard data exchange formats and APIs as per the building blocks' recommendations.

Collaborate with relevant government agencies and stakeholders to align with broader interoperability initiatives and best practices recommended by the building blocks.

1. Identify potential integration points within your system.
2. Choose widely used standards and protocols for these points (like JSON or XML for data interchange, REST or GraphQL for APIs, and OAuth or SAML for authentication).
3. Implement these standards in your system.
4. Test the system to ensure it can interact correctly with other systems.
