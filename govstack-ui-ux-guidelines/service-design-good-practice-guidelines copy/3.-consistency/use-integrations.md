# Use integrations

Consider potential integration points and interoperability requirements early in the design process, involving relevant stakeholders, including the building blocks development team.

1. Identify functionalities that can be provided by other services, for example departmental registries.
2. Integrate these services using their APIs.
3. Test the integrations to ensure they work correctly.
4. Be prepared to handle any downtime or changes to these services.
