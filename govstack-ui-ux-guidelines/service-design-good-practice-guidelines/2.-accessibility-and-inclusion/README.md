# 2. Accessibility and inclusion

## Test for accessibility

There could be significant interdependencies between UI components for different accessibility requirements. The world-wide web consortium and Web accessibility initiative have developed standards for  ([WCAG, ATAG, UAAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/#guidelines))  considering the needs of developers, authoring tools, accessibility evaluation tools and guidelines on how to make user-agents(browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers) accessible to users.
