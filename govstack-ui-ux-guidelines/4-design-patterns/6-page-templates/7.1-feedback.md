## **How it Works**

### **Prompt for Feedback**

Throughout your service journey, prompt users to provide feedback.

### **Feedback Form**

This could be a dedicated page that opens in a new tab or a modal within the page. Provide a simple text area where users can input their thoughts and experiences. The prompt should be open-ended, such as "Tell us about your experience" or "How can we improve this page?"

### **Submit Button**

Include a clear call to action button for submitting feedback. "Submit feedback" is an effective, straightforward choice.

### **Success Confirmation**

After users submit their feedback, display a success message to let them know it was received successfully. This can be a simple statement like "Thank you, your feedback has been submitted."

### Data you might collect

* Page URL: This shows the specific page where the user submitted feedback, giving you context about what their comments may be referring to.
* Referrer URL: This indicates the page the user visited before the current one, which could be useful for understanding the user's journey.
* Device Information: This includes data like the user's operating system, browser type, and screen resolution, which can be helpful for troubleshooting technical issues.
* Timestamp: Recording the time and date of the feedback can help identify issues that occur at specific times.
* Session ID: If your system uses session IDs, collecting this can help you associate the feedback with a particular user session.

## **When to use this pattern**

You should aim to collect feedback whenever possible, it can be helpful in identifying issues or areas for improvement from the user's perspective.

## **When not to use this pattern**

At the end points of the user journey, you should use the satisfaction pattern.
