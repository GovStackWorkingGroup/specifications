## **Considerations for choosing different patterns**

### **Step by step guide to help you pick the right patterns for your service:**&#x20;

* [Identify Service Needs](../service-design-good-practice-guidelines/1.-user-centred-design/): use the [GovStack playbook](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/govstack-implementation-playbook/design-and-delivery/user-journeys) to understand the key interactions in your service.
* Map User Flows: Break down the user journey into phases like registration, information collection, appointments, feedback, and messaging. Identify the steps users take in each flow. [Consider the technology choices available to you](../service-design-good-practice-guidelines/4.-technology-choices/).
* Choose Patterns: Identify the patterns (task-focused page types) needed for each flow. For instance, registration might use a sign-up pattern, while information collection could involve question pages.
* Select Components: Patterns often include several components. Start with existing patterns for common tasks. For unique requirements, you may need to mix and match individual components.
